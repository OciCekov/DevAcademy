//  Write a program that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
//        Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:
//        We are living in an yellow submarine. 
//        We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. 
//        So we are drinking all the day.
//        We will move out of it in 5 days.


//    The result is: 9.
