The objective of the game is to find all the pairs in the deck. 
The size of the deck depends on the level you choose:

1) Easy - 4x4 cards
2) Medium - 6x6 cards
3) Hard - 8x8 cards

Move the cursor with the arrow keys on the keyboard until you reach the card 
you want to open and then press Enter. Do the same for the second card. 
If they match you have found a pair and the cards will remain open. 
If they don't match the cards will be closed. 

Do the same until you find all the pairs. 
Try to do it for the least possible time with the least possible moves.
